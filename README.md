# ChatUCF

Android Application: Location-based Chatrooms on UCF campus.
Written in collaboration with Arjune Watane, Mitchell Crozier, and Rubba Ashwas for COP4331 Processes of Object-Oriented Software Design.
This is a modified version of Kevin Gleason's example application from PubNub.

Features that were modified/added:
    1. Established multiple chatrooms
    2. Sort chat rooms by distance from user
    3. Send/Receive messages
    4. Facebook Login
    5. Designated chatrooms across campus
    6. Shows available users in chatroom
    7. Geofencingâ€“2 mile range
    8. 200 character message limit
    
Main lesson learned from this project: utilization and integration of 3rd party API (PubNub Streaming Service).
